Scheduling Algorithms
=====================

This project implements several scheduling algorithms related to theoretical research in scheduling theory.
In particular, it contains implementations of the following algorithms for *Elastic Mixed-Criticality* model:
*  Scheduling with local early release
*  Scheduling with global early release
*  Scheduling with multiprocessor slack reclamation
